# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the existing HireWise n8n workflow to include more diverse features that will significantly improve the interview preparation experience. The current workflow provides basic question generation and feedback functionality, but lacks advanced features like industry-specific customization, multi-modal content processing, performance analytics, and adaptive learning capabilities.

The enhanced workflow will transform HireWise from a basic interview preparation tool into a comprehensive, intelligent platform that adapts to user needs, provides industry-specific insights, and offers detailed performance tracking and improvement recommendations.
