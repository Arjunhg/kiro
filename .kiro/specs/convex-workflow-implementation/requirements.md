# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves implementing a comprehensive Convex database workflow for the HireWise AI interview preparation platform. The system needs to manage users, interview sessions, questions, answers, and feedback in a scalable and efficient manner. The implementation should follow Convex best practices while maintaining simplicity and focusing on the core functionality needed for AI-powered interview preparation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the HireWise platform, I want my account information to be securely stored and managed, so that I can have a personalized interview preparation experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up through Clerk authentication THEN the system SHALL create a new user record in the Convex database
2. WHEN a user already exists in the database THEN the system SHALL return the existing user record without creating duplicates
3. WHEN user information is stored THEN the system SHALL include Clerk ID, email, name, image URL, and creation timestamp
4. WHEN querying users THEN the system SHALL use indexed queries for optimal performance
5. IF a user's Clerk ID is provided THEN the system SHALL be able to retrieve the user record efficiently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user preparing for interviews, I want to create and manage interview sessions with different job requirements, so that I can practice for specific roles and companies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an interview session THEN the system SHALL store job title, optional job description, and optional resume URL
2. WHEN an interview session is created THEN the system SHALL assign it a status of "draft" by default
3. WHEN interview questions are generated THEN the system SHALL store them as an ordered array with question text and order number
4. WHEN a user starts answering questions THEN the system SHALL update the interview status to "in_progress"
5. WHEN all questions are answered THEN the system SHALL allow updating the status to "completed"
6. IF a user provides a resume URL THEN the system SHALL store it as optional metadata for the session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user taking an AI interview, I want my answers to be recorded and stored securely, so that I can receive feedback and track my progress over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides an answer to a question THEN the system SHALL update the specific question's answer field
2. WHEN an answer is recorded THEN the system SHALL maintain the question order and associate it with the correct question
3. WHEN multiple answers are provided THEN the system SHALL support batch updates for performance
4. WHEN an interview is in progress THEN the system SHALL allow partial completion and resumption
5. IF an answer is updated THEN the system SHALL overwrite the previous answer for that question

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who completed an interview, I want to receive detailed feedback on my performance, so that I can identify areas for improvement and track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an interview is completed THEN the system SHALL allow storing comprehensive feedback data
2. WHEN feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL include overall rating, strengths array, improvements array, and detailed feedback text
3. WHEN feedback is stored THEN the system SHALL update the interview completion timestamp
4. WHEN feedback is retrieved THEN the system SHALL return all feedback components in a structured format
5. IF feedback already exists THEN the system SHALL allow updates to the feedback data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of the platform, I want to view my interview history and progress, so that I can track my improvement over time and revisit previous sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their interview history THEN the system SHALL return all interviews ordered by creation date (newest first)
2. WHEN displaying interview lists THEN the system SHALL include session metadata, status, and completion information
3. WHEN a specific interview is requested THEN the system SHALL return complete interview data including questions, answers, and feedback
4. WHEN querying interviews THEN the system SHALL use indexed queries for optimal performance
5. IF a user has many interviews THEN the system SHALL support pagination for large datasets

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want the database schema and functions to follow best practices, so that the system is maintainable, performant, and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining the database schema THEN the system SHALL use appropriate indexes for common query patterns
2. WHEN implementing functions THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling and validation
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use type-safe validators and controlled string values
4. WHEN performing database operations THEN the system SHALL validate user ownership and authorization
5. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into logical modules (users, interviews, feedback)
6. IF performance optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL implement batch operations and pagination
